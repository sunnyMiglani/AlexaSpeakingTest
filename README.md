# AlexaSpeakingTest
Alexa Speaking Test repository. To see how the information needs to be structured for users to understand the information only via voice


# Program Flow:

The program uses the normal flow of any Alexa based JS Skill

However the two intents in this system are particularly designed to test out the 
different ways or systems of presenting information only through audio.

The two systems are:

1) Large paragraphs with obvious gaps
2) Large paragraphs with no gaps
3) Smaller lines with prompt's asking to continue


This allows us to test the different structures in a **co-design** session and 
help spark ideas for different structures to work with for presenting such information


# About:

This is part of a Co-design system for the University of Bristol's Bristol Interaction Group focused on HCI research
